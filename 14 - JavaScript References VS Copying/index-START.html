    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    //Arrays and objects are passed by reference 


    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const newArr = [].concat(oldArr)
    const newArr2 = Array.from(oldArr)
    const newArr3 = [...oldArr]
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const newObj = Object.assign({}, oldObj, {newProp:"some value"}) 
    //If two or more objects entered into .assign have the same properties than the last property entered will overide the former one.

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const newObj = {...oldObj, newProp:"some value"}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    
    //When we do a deep clone our performance takes a hit so we should use it sparingly!
